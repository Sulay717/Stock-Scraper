# Stock-Scraper'

As an interesting example of web scraping, I would like a script that takes a list of stock tickers and returns their high, low, and current prices.

 

Don’t use beautifulsoup, keep it as barebones as possible.
Expected input:

 

>> Enter a stock ticker (enter ‘1’ if done adding to list): SPY

Added

>> Enter a stock ticker (enter ‘1’ if done adding to list): QQQ

Added

>> Enter a stock ticker (enter ‘1’ if done adding to list): 1

Here are your stocks:

Stock --- High --- Low --- Current Price

SPY --- 430 --- 425 --- 427.89
